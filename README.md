## Dataset Descriptions
The current data analyses are from Dr. Light's previous study on **self-concept clarity, well-being, possible selves, and age**. 
\
Another dataset I have is the dataset for my thesis. The dataset contains the Self-Concept Clarity Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Life-Marker Scale, and SCC Norm Scale. I will perform a linear regression analysis for this dataset if I can clean up the data before the final (I just received my data).
\
The data is in the format of .sav and can be opened in R using the "foreign" packages or the “haven” packages.
## Overview of the Project
The research question is to explore the potential explanations underlying the curvilinear relationships between the importance of self-concept clarity to well-being across the lifespan. 
\
The explanations contained in the current datasets include social roles, role entries, etc., and the collecting data includes deviance from the social clock.
