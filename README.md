## Dataset Descriptions
These current datasets are from Dr. Light's previous study on **self-concept clarity, well-being, and age**. 
There are three different datasets that I can use or integrate along with data from my study, which will be collected soon, adding to the datasets during the quarter.
The data is in the format of .sav and can be opened in R using the "foreign" packages or the “haven” packages.
## Overview of the Project
The research question is to explore the potential explanations underlying the curvilinear relationships between the importance of self-concept clarity to well-being across the lifespan. 
The explanations contained in the current datasets include social roles, role entries, etc., and the collecting data includes deviance from the social clock.

!(3>4)

1==2|2==2
