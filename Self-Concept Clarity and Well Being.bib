  abstract = {Exiting the labor force earlier or later than planned is common, with predictable economic consequences. However, the mental health ramifications of such off-time events are not known but are important to promoting well-being in retirement.Using the Health and Retirement Study (1992--2016), we created 6 groups based on the alignment of expectations about full-time work at age 62 (reported at ages 51--61) with realized labor force status after reaching age 62 (N = 10,421). Negative binomial models estimated the adjusted association between unmet expectations about work and depressive symptoms.Unexpectedly not working was associated with higher depressive symptoms than working as expected after adjusting for sociodemographic, economic, and health factors at the time of expectations (incidence rate ratio = 1.35, 95\% confidence interval: 1.17--1.56). Additionally, adjusting for health declines and marriage dissolution between expectations and age 62 partially attenuated the association, but unexpectedly not working remained significantly associated with a 1.16 increase in the incidence rate of depressive symptoms. Unexpectedly working at 62 was not associated with depressive symptoms. Race/ethnicity interacted with expectation alignment (F(15,42) = 2.44, p = .0118) in that Hispanic respondents experienced an increase in depressive symptoms when working after unmet and unsure expectations compared to met expectations, whereas White respondents did not.Unlike working longer than expected, unexpectedly not working at age 62 was associated with depressive symptoms, even after accounting for health declines. Public and employer policies should assist workers in remaining in the labor force as long as planned and offer mental health supports for unexpected work exits.},

The focus was on whether conceptions of the transition to adulthood would be different among young-to-midlife adults compared to the younger age groups. In all age groups, individualistic criteria were the most likely to be considered important markers of the transition to adulthood, specifically accepting responsibility for one's actions, deciding on one's beliefs and values, establishing an equal relationship with parents, and becoming financially independent. However, young-to-midlife adults were less likely than adolescents to consider biological transitions to be important, and more likely than adolescents or emerging adults to view norm compliance (such as avoiding drunk driving) as a necessary part of the transition to adulthood. In all three groups, role transitions (e.g., marriage) ranked lowest in importance.},

  abstract = {The major changes of the transition to adulthood are argued to be stressful, and health-related behaviors such as smoking and physical activity may be adopted, consolidated, or abandoned at this time. On the other hand, research has suggested that the normative transitions of emerging adulthood, although involving considerable change, may be associated with low stress because they are perceived as both positive and normal at this life stage. This article examines relations between the timing and sequencing of life transitions and stress and health-related behaviors, focusing on the transition to young adulthood among Australian women. A total of 853 women aged 22 to 27 provided information about the timing and sequencing of 6 life transitions: moving out of home, stopping full-time education, starting full-time work, having the first live-in relationship, marriage, and motherhood---and stress, smoking, and physical activity. Most had moved out of home, stopped full-time education, and started full-time work, but only 14\% had undertaken all 6 transitions. Overall, 70\% of participants had made transitions ``in order.'' Overall, the findings suggest that the relations between timing and sequencing of transitions, and indicators of health, are moderate for smoking, but small for stress and for physical activity. These effects remained after controlling for socioeconomic status of the participants'families of origin. Matching current social norms for the timing and sequencing of life changes may be of less importance for women's well-being than is commonly believed. Although the significant relations between early or ``out of order'' transitions and smoking are of concern, the smaller relations with stress and with sedentariness suggest that such transitions may have limited negative consequences, and support the view that individuals are active in choosing the life path that is appropriate for them and their circumstances.},

Four studies examined the relations among measures of self-concept structure and their relations with adjustment. The measures of self-concept structure included two that we viewed as reflecting self-concept pluralism (self-complexity and self-concept compartmentalization) and four that we viewed as reflecting self-concept unity (self-concept differentiation, self-concept clarity, self-discrepancies, and the average correlation among participants' self-aspects). The measures of self-concept pluralism were unrelated to one another, were unrelated to the measures of self-concept unity, and were unrelated to the measures of adjustment. The measures of self-concept unity were moderately related to one another and were moderately related to the measures of adjustment.},

With the development of society, the relevant variables affecting life satisfaction have also changed with the times. The purpose of this study is to research the relationship between parent and child or peer alienation, mental resilience, self-concept clarity and life satisfaction, finding the mechanism of action among parent-child or peer alienation, mental resilience, self-concept clarity, and life satisfaction. This cross-sectional study recruites randomly 1,347 adolescents from six middle schools in Chongqing, China, participating in a questionnaire on sociodemographic characteristics, the Inventor of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), the Self-concept Clarity Scale (SCCS), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). The sample consists of 62.4\% female participants (n = 841) and 37.6\% male participants (n = 506) aged from 11 to 17 years old (Mean = 14.54, SD = 1.21). We use SPSS 26 to perform the statistical analysis. The study finds that mental resilience---self-concept clarity have mediating effect on the parent or peer alienation to life satisfaction, to the effect that, parent-child or peer alienation explain life satisfaction through the chain mediating effect of mental resilience---self-concept clarity. This study explores the negative multi-use of parent-child or peer alienation on life satisfaction and provides a new perspective for the improvement of life satisfaction of adolescents.},

Studies have linked low self-concept clarity to poor psychological adjustment and functioning and high self-concept clarity to adaptive psychological adjustment and functioning. Low self-concept clarity has also been linked to a variety of types of psychopathology, including depression, anxiety, and autism. However, the majority of work on the relations between self-concept clarity and psychopathology has focused on its role in schizophrenia spectrum disorders such as schizophrenia, attenuated psychotic disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder. In this chapter, the relations between self-concept clarity and depression, anxiety disorders, and autism spectrum disorders are briefly reviewed. Then, evidence for disturbances in self-concept clarity in schizophrenia is reviewed and linked to a long history of research dating back to the earliest descriptions of the disorder that conceptualized schizophrenia as a disorder primarily of the self.},

Because people tend to desire high self-esteem, such discrepancies are generally larger among individuals low in self-esteem. Among college students (Study 1) and in a more diverse sample (Study 2), we found that the relationship between actual self-esteem and self-clarity was stronger among participants who had high levels of desired self-esteem. Further supporting the causal role of actual-desired self-esteem discrepancies in predicting self-clarity, Study 3 found that a manipulation designed to make high self-esteem seem less desirable reduced the relationship between self-esteem and clarity. These results demonstrate the importance of considering not only people's actual levels of self-esteem, but also their desired levels. Implications for the possible origins and consequences of self-clarity are discussed.},

  abstract = {Subjective well-being (SWB) comprises people's longer-term levels of pleasant affect, lack of unpleasant affect, and life satisfaction. It displays moderately high levels of cross-situational consistency and temporal stability. Self-report measures of SWB show adequate validity, reliability, factor invariance, and sensitivity to change. Despite the success of the measures to date, more sophisticated approaches to defining and measuring SWB are now possible. Affect includes facial, physiological, motivational, behavioral, and cognitive components. Self-reports assess primarily the cognitive component of affect, and thus are unlikely to yield a complete picture of respondents' emotional lives. For example, denial may influence self-reports of SWB more than other components. Additionally, emotions are responses which vary on a number of dimensions such as intensity, suggesting that mean levels of affect as captured by existing measures do not give a complete account of SWB. Advances in cognitive psychology indicate that differences in memory retrieval, mood as information, and scaling processes can influence self-reports of SWB. Finally, theories of communication alert us to the types of information that are likely to be given in self-reports of SWB. These advances from psychology suggest that a multimethod approach to assessing SWB will create a more comprehensive depiction of the phenomenon. Not only will a multifaceted test battery yield more credible data, but inconsistencies between various measurement methods and between the various components of well-being will both help us better understand SWB indictors and group differences in well-being. Knowledge of cognition, personality, and emotion will also aid in the development of sophisticated theoretical definitions of subjective well-being. For example, life satisfaction is theorized to be a judgment that respondents construct based on currently salient information. Finally, it is concluded that measuring negative reactions such as depression or anxiety give an incomplete picture of people's well-being, and that it is imperative to measure life satisfaction and positive emotions as well.},

Results show that personality characteristics were related to life outcomes across the 1st 20 yrs of adulthood. 70 Ss who had their 1st child by age 28 were on the feminine social clockwork; 20 Ss were late adherents, having their 1st child after age 28; remaining Ss followed neither social clock pattern, or they followed a masculine occupational clock. It is suggested that, having described social clock projects and their normative time parameters, the relative goodness of fit between individuals' needs and the ecology of nested contexts in which they feel they must try to gratify them can be examined.

I propose that self-concept clarity may foster well-being by facilitating successful self-regulation and goal pursuit. This chapter outlines the role of the self-concept in several prominent theories of self-regulation, and details how, given these mechanistic roles, an unclear sense of self might undermine self-regulation and goal pursuit. Focusing on self-regulation may help to differentiate self-concept clarity from its close correlate, self-esteem, as low self-esteem and low self-concept clarity are associated with unique predictions in the domain of goal pursuit. I argue that thinking about the mechanisms linking self-concept clarity to positive outcomes can help us to better understand self-concept clarity more generally.},

For female participants, employed women have higher relatedness than non-employed women. In addition, married participants have more relatedness and life-satisfaction, and less depression than unmarried participants.

The results of Study 1 revealed a belief by the vast majority that descriptive age norms still exist for both family transitions (marriage, parenthood, grandparenthood) and career transitions (leaving school, retirement). While these results were in keeping with those of Neugarten et al.'s [1] original study of age norms in the United States, the actual ``best'' normative ages recommended by this sample of contemporary Australian adults differed in every case from the U.S. age norms [1] of three decades ago. Matching contemporary demographic trends, the present Australian young-adult sample advocated later ages for marriage and grandparenthood, a younger norm for leaving school, and a broader normative age range for retiring from work. Study 2 tested Neugarten's hypothesis that age norms today lack some of the prescriptive overtones implicit in original ``social clock'' concept [2]. The results supported this suggestion. In fact, only a minority of contemporary Australian adults believed that there were prescriptive upper age boundaries for first marriage or university study. Furthermore, their prescriptive lower age limits for every transition except retirement fell at or below the onset of adulthood itself (18 years), in keeping with biological constraints on procreation and maturational constraints on social and cognitive development. The mean ranges of acceptability prescribed by this Australian sample for each key adult transition were likewise very wide, stretching from an average of twenty-four years (for motherhood) to forty-nine years (for a man's first marriage). This result also contrasts sharply with the ranges of no more than five years prescribed for the same transitions by the vast majority of Neugarten et al.'s sample three decade ago [1]. The probable consequences for self-esteem, mental health and life planning of this heightened variability and reduced prescriptiveness in the timing of life events for contemporary men and women were discussed.},

  abstract = {Although gains and losses are an integral part of human development, the experience of change and readjustment that often comes with major life events may be particularly influential for an individual's subjective aging experience and awareness of age-related change (AARC). Thus, this study focused on the role of life events in the domains of family and health for an individual's awareness of age-related gains and losses. Specifically, we differentiated between the experience of specific life events (e.g., entering a new romantic relationship; hospital stay) and the cumulative experience of multiple life events. Furthermore, we differentiated between life events experienced at an expected time in life and life events experienced relatively early or relatively late compared to established social norms. Data came from the Innovation Sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP-IS) and consisted of 1,612 participants aged 16 to 93 years (M = 54.1; SD = 18.2). Life events were assessed annually and retrospectively for the last 2 years. Propensity score matching provided evidence for an association of specific family life events and a higher awareness of age-related gains, as well as specific health life events and a higher awareness of age-related losses. Results furthermore indicated that the cumulative experience of family life events was associated with a higher awareness of age-related gains. Conversely, the cumulative experience of health events was associated with higher awareness of both age-related losses and age-related gains. Moreover, it was not only life events happening at an expected age, but also those happening relatively early and particularly those happening late in life, which were associated with AARC. In summary, life events and the change they may bring seem to be reflected in individuals' awareness of age-related losses and awareness of age-related gains.},

  abstract = {The present chapter discusses the overlap and interplay between personal identity and self-concept clarity. Personal identity is framed as an active agent, the ``I,'' that sorts through and organizes self-relevant information. Self-concept clarity is framed as the object, the ``me,'' that represents the self-conception being constructed. The I is framed as creating the me through a process of self-authorship, where self-verification processes assist in this authorship and create turning points when the me is not verified and is in need of change. Personal identity processes, such as exploration, commitment, and reconsideration, are posited as mechanisms through which self-concept clarity is developed and maintained. The chapter also examines domain specificity of personal identity and self-concept clarity, such that a person may be clearer about her-/himself in some areas but less so in others. The chapter concludes with implications for developing interventions to strengthen individuals' sense of personal identity and self-concept clarity.},

Baumgardner, 1990; J. Campbell, 1990). Self-concept confusion should mitigate against the use of a decision-making strategy that involves using the self to guide choice behavior (i.e., prototype matching, P. M. Niedenthal, N. Cantor, \& J. F. Kihlstrom, 1985). Two correlational studies demonstrated that people with high self-esteem, but not low self-esteem, made use of prototype matching in forming preferences. In a 3rd study, the self-concept was made more clear or made more confused. Clarity was associated with the use of prototype matching regardless of level of self-esteem. Self-concept confusion was associated with a failure to use the strategy regardless of level of self-esteem.},

  abstract = {In modern industrialized societies, young people face an extended period of unprecedented freedom, and challenges, en route to fully adult roles. Using the Markers of Adulthood Scale, I explore the markers emerging adults view as most important to achieving adulthood, their attainment of those markers, and how the fit between the two relates to participants' overall well-being. Results showed that the most important markers for well-being were those over which young adults have more control: relational maturity (e.g., establishing an equal relationship with parents and developing greater consideration for others). In contrast, the markers which most emerging adults had yet to attain and had relatively less control over (i.e., traditional role transitions such as being settled into a career) did not predict well-being. Overall, it appears that emerging adults construct personal conceptualizations of adulthood adaptively, although results suggested that the path to adulthood may be more elusive for females than males.},

These role transitions can be disruptive to the way individuals view their identity, and thus their well-being; however, role transitions do not affect all individuals equally. Therefore, in the current work, we focused on two factors which may influence self-concept clarity and explain differential experiences following role transitions. We tested the relationship between the amount of self-change and positive emotions in reaction to a role transition predicting self-concept clarity, including both role entries (e.g. parenthood/new relationships, Studies 1--4) and role exits (e.g. divorce/job loss, Studies 3 and 4). Across several studies and all role transitions, we found that among individuals who experienced low levels of positive emotions after a role transition, greater self-change predicted reduced self-concept clarity. Among individuals who experienced higher levels of positive emotionality, this association did not emerge.},

We begin with an overview of these role transitions broadly defined, reviewing literature showing that both entering into a new social role and exiting a social role can undermine self-concept clarity. We then focus specifically on social role transition within romantic relationship contexts. In particular, we review the literature on relationship dissolution and self-concept clarity. Although, in general, the end of a relationship tends to undermine self-concept clarity, we highlight several moderators that can attenuate this effect. We then turn to the consequences of experiencing low self-concept clarity after the end of a relationship for well-being. Finally, we highlight six unresolved issues in this literature and identify directions for future research on social role transitions and self-concept clarity.},

  abstract = {Current cognitive models stress the importance of negative self-perceptions in maintaining social anxiety, but focus predominantly on content rather than structure. Two studies examine the role of self-structure (self-organisation, self-complexity, and self-concept clarity) in social anxiety. In study one, self-organisation and self-concept clarity were correlated with social anxiety, and a step-wise multiple regression showed that after controlling for depression and self-esteem, which explained 35\% of the variance in social anxiety scores, self-concept clarity uniquely predicted social anxiety and accounted for an additional 7\% of the variance in social anxiety scores in an undergraduate sample (N=95) and the interaction between self-concept clarity and compartmentalisation (an aspect of evaluative self-organisation) at step 3 of the multiple regression accounted for a further 3\% of the variance in social anxiety scores. In study two, high (n=26) socially anxious participants demonstrated less self-concept clarity than low socially anxious participants (n=26) on both self-report (used in study one) and on computerised measures of self-consistency and confidence in self-related judgments. The high socially anxious group had more compartmentalised self-organisation than the low anxious group, but there were no differences between the two groups on any of the other measures of self-organisation. Self-complexity did not contribute to social anxiety in either study, although this may have been due to the absence of a stressor. Overall, the results suggest that self-structure has a potentially important role in understanding social anxiety and that self-concept clarity and other aspects of self-structure such as compartmentalisation interact with each other and could be potential maintaining factors in social anxiety. Cognitive therapy for social phobia might influence self-structure, and understanding the role of structural variables in maintenance and treatment could eventually help to improve treatment outcome.},

  abstract = {Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have far-reaching effects on adult mental health yet questions remain how these effects are transmitted psychologically. Because ACEs are rooted in disrupted caregiver-child relationships and are associated with negative self-views and poor social competencies, we hypothesized ACEs disrupt the development of a coherent sense of identity. This impoverished sense of self may then lead to poor adult mental health. The present study hypothesized ACEs effects on adult mental health are mediated by the clarity of one's identity. We tested a model guided by the Hyman-Tate conceptual timing criterion for mediation on a sample of 305 adults and used self-concept clarity as identity coherence, and suicide behavior, depression, loneliness, perceived stress, and life distress as adult mental health outcomes. Results supported the hypothesized process: self-concept clarity mediated the effects of ACEs on all outcomes with small to medium indirect effect sizes and remained controlling for demographic variables. After including self-esteem as another mediator, all self-concept clarity indirect effects remained significant except for suicide behavior. Discussion centers on how ACEs relates to lower identity coherence and how to improve identity coherence for adult mental health.},

Two serial mediation models revealed that self-concept clarity and hope independently mediated the effect of family cohesion on subjective well-being. More importantly, family cohesion could influence subjective well-being through the chain mediating effect of ``self-concept clarity--hope''. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the links between these factors and suggest that high level of family cohesion may promote subjective well-being through the high level of self-concept clarity and hope.},
